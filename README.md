# JK-Crib
#Node.js #Express #Handlebars

This project is a part of the course Web Development Fundamentals at Jönköping University.
The task is to individually create a personal website, with some specific pages and functions. The
knowledge and abilities that are taught in this course should be used to create the project.
These are for example HTML, CSS, JavaScript and understanding how to use different
frameworks, like Express, in a Node.js application. The goal is to create and deploy a secure
website on the internet. The outcome will consist of the web application itself and this report.

There are some criteria’s the students must follow in order to fulfill the requirements of this
project. The website must consist of:
- Basic pages; home/start page, about page and contact page.
- At least three different type of resources on the website – stored in a database.
- A single admin account, which can apply CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete)
operations on the recourses.

The primary goal for this project is, within the time frame and with deadline in week 42, to
create a fully functional and secure web application on the internet. The outcome is to also
deliver this project report and an orally presentation for the teacher and other students.


JK-Crib is Johan Kantola’s personal website where visitors can find information about him, read
his blog, write comments to his blogposts and check out his portfolio. To distinguish Johan from
other visitors, there is a login functionality with a single administrator account on the website.
